# testmints

Do your tests have a great personality but have bad breath? Just looking for a way to freshen up your tests after a big meal of refactoring?

Testmints is here for you.

Testmints is a low-cal solution to bring a tiny bit of sugar to your Kotlin Multiplatform tests, hopefully improving readability and just generally making things less smelly.

Don't like the flavor? Submit a PR, or just don't use em. :-D
